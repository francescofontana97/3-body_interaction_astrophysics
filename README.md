# Three-Body Interaction in Young and Nuclear Star Clusters

## Final project for the "Laboratory of Computational Physics" course at Unipd during 2020/2021.

The object is to analysed the dataset of the different behaviour of 3-body interaction in Young Star Cluster (*YSC*) and Nuclear Star Cluster (*NSC*) and retrieve some statistics about this astrophysical phenomena.

### Individual contributions:
* Francesco Fontana: 1-Preprocessing data, 4-Plots of trajectories, 5-Future mergings;
* Lorenzo Mancini: 3-Graphs;
* Giulio Vicentini : 2-Classification.
